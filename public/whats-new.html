<h3>What's New</h3>

<p>July 5, 2018</p>

<p>We have some new enhancements for the Product Request form. We have seperated the "In Progress" forms from the "Closed". Going forward, there will be a resolution code added to each closed form, so you can quickly scan and see the status of your request. </p> 
<p>We have also built a notification icon that will show when a form has a question for you to answer. Look for that in the top right corner of the portal, it will only appear when there is an active notification for you.</p>
<p>More enchancements will be rolling out over the next couple of weeks. We hope you enjoy it, if you have any feedback, please hit the feedback button in the footer and let us know!</p>
