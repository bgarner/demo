Meet Zip.\nTurn your everyday life into a fun path to  tness.\nMuch more than a pedometer, Zip tracks your steps, distance, and calories burned -- then automatically syncs the data to your Fitbit account through your computer or select smart phones. Whether online or through the Fitbit App, you can set goals and stay motivated to keep on your path to  tness with graphs, badges, and friendly competitions. Check to see how you compare with friends and family and even provide a message to egg them on. Your stats wirelessly upload via computer or select Bluetooth 4.0 smartphones and tablets (like the iPhone 4S, iPhone 5), so you will know in real time when you are close\nto a goal and when you’ve reached one.\nBuilt to keep you moving\nPowered by Fitbit’s leading-edge accelerometer technology, ZipTM accurately captures all-day activity that old-school pedometers can’t handle.\n"];
