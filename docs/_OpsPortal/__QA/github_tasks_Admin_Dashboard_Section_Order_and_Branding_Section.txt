#### Section Order
- [ ] Section order should be as follows:
  * Branding (see below)
  * Featured Content
  * Quicklinks
  * Notification Preferences

#### Dashboard Sections: Title and Branding
* LAYOUT REFERENCE FILE: Admin-Dashboard-Form-Title_plus_Branding.png
- [ ] Merge these two sections into the Branding section, with 3 fields:
  * Title
  * Subtitle
  * Background

##### Update Title and Subtitle fields
- [ ] Required field Title field needs asterisk
- [ ] Subtitle field should not be required. (i.e. Layout on the front end should adjust accordingly.)
- [ ] Removing focus from either the Title field when itâ€™s empty should:
  - [ ] cause the field to be outlined in red
  - [ ] cause the Save changes button to be disabled

##### Background image selection
- [ ] Thumbnail should be much smaller
- [ ] background selection should not use file upload, images should be selected from assets within the Document Library
- [ ] Add functional copy adjacent to background selection:

*For best results, background images should have an aspect ratio of X:Y  and be at least XXX pixels wide.*

##### Controls
- [ ] Rename button **Cancel** to **Undo changes**
- [ ] Change **Undo changes** icon from cancel/close to the undo icon
  - [ ] **Undo changes** should be disabled when no changes have been initiated
  - [ ] Undo functionality otherwise unchanged (i.e. clicking it restores the last saved Title, Subtitle and background image values)
- [ ] button **Save changes** should use a save icon
- [ ] **Save changes** should be disabled when:
  - [ ] no changes are pending (e.g. page load or immediately following save)
  - [ ] changes are invalid (e.g. either/both required fields are empty)
- [ ] Saving changes should not generate a modal.
  - [ ] display text *Changes saved.* preceded by checkmark icon just above the button
  - [ ] button reverts to disabled state
  - [ ] message fades out after 5 seconds, OR
