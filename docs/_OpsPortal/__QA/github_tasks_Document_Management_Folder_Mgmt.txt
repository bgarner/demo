### Admin - Documents - Manage Folders - General



* When a user is in this are, the left nave should reflect this:
  - [ ] the Documents tab should be expanded
  - [ ] the Manage Folders item should be highlighted/Active (e.g. white, bold font)

* Folder interaction
  - [ ] Add a placeholding, uneditable, top-level folder for the banner (e.g. Sport Chek).
  - [ ] By default, this root/banner folder should be expanded so all its first-level child folders are visible.
  - [ ] the folder icon should consistently reflect whether a folder is expanded or not
  - [ ] The Edit icon for any visible folder should be visible 100% of the time
  - [ ] Folder names should exactly reflect the capitalization used when entered (i.e. do not apply CSS rules like capitalize to folder names in any context)
  - [ ] Adjacent to each folder icon, name, and edit icon, add an Add subfolder button
      - [ ] this new button triggers a modal where a folder name is entered and the user simply confirms or cancels this

  * Editing folders
    * Modal: Edit Folder
